# Project1-Team2

## Description

We built a website where the users can store the information of a movie. The application was created because movie fans want to keep track of the movies they've watched so far, as well as make comments about them. The user can enter the title, genre and rating of a movie. Also, the users are able to organize the movie information they store alphabetically.
