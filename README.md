# Project1-Team2

## Description

We built a website where the users can store the information of a movie. The application was created because movie fans want to keep track of the movies they've watched so far, as well as make comments about them. The user can enter the title, rating, genre and some comments of a movie. Also, the users are able to organize the movie information they store alphabetically.
In the third page the users are able to see the details of every movie they've stored.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Installation

## Usage

The website has three pages: Main, Input and Movie Info. The user can navigate through every page.

In the Main page, the user can see all of the movies they have input into the web application. The movie title, rating and genre are displayed, and the movies are sorted by the order in which they were input into the site. To see the comments added for a specific movie, the user can simply click anywhere in the movie's row (i.e., click the title, rating or genre), and the user will be taken to the MovieInfo.html. To add a new movie, the user can type in a new movie title on index.html, and click submit to be redirected to input.html. The movie title will then be automatically filled in, and the user can input the movie rating, genre and comments manually before clicking submit and being redirected back to the home page, where this new movie will be displayed.
